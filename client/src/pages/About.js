            Adoption Saves Lives Each year, over 7 million dogs and cats enter
            shelters nationwide, and nearly 3 million don’t make it out alive.
            It doesn’t have to be that way. An estimated 17 million people will
            add a new pet to their families this year. If more of them would
            choose to adopt a pet, instead of buying one from a pet store,
            breeder or online, we could significantly reduce the number of
            animals killed in shelters.
          </li>
          <li>Because you'll help a pet in need.</li>
          <li>Because you'll find a great addition to your family.</li>
          <li>Because it’ll cost less.</li>
          <li>
            You'll encourage others to adopt from shelters when they see how
            awesome your own pet is.
          </li>
          <li>Because it's one way to fight puppy mills.</li>
