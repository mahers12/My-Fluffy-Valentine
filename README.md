Are you tired of scrolling through troves of online matches without having any luck? Are you exhausted at the mere idea of getting ready for yet another mediocre date? Are you fretting spending another night on the couch alone? Well, I got just the solution for you. Find true love this valentine's day by adopting a furry friend. valentine's day is the perfect day to show some love and help rescue animals in need. Because Scrappy and Meowise should not be alone on valentine's day and neither should you.

My-Fluffy-Valentine is a webpage meant to match future pet parents with shelter pets in the area. Users start on the home page by filling out their personal information (name, address, and contact information). The user then can navigate to a page with all the animals available for adoption. The user can click on the pet picture to get information such as: pet name, age and health records. The page will also display the shelter information where the pets can be adopted. The user can also choose to sponsor a pet, or donate to a shelter of their choosing.
